        <h3>If you have never heard of the word "branding" or aren't sure what it means, here is a short explanation to help you seize the subtilities of the brand creation process and how professionals conceive it.</h3>

        <h2>1. The difference between branding and marketing</h2>

            <h3>When marketing speaks to clients, the brand is the story you tell your family on Christmas Eve.</h3>
            <p>Branding is the creation of a brand. Its function is to speak to everyone: partners, providers, even your banker! A brand is what makes stakeholders believe in your project and engage themselves, not only financially, in it. It is as fundamental as the project itself. For a strategic planner, the brand strategy goes before the marketing strategy unless the marketing strategy itself is the brand.</p> 
            <p>Of course, the brand is also part of marketing, it couldn't be otherwise. The brand is an intrinsic part of the commercial process. Telling stories helps catch the customer's attention and ensure they get the message we want. This is what we call storytelling.</p>
            <p>The fact is that humans love stories. It helps us communicate and understand the vision of the future we share so we can work together towards it. Have you ever heard of the "vision" of a CEO? This is branding, spectacularly. A story aimed to speak to all people who need to be involved in our project, not just customers.</p>
            <h3>A few common elements between branding and marketing.</h3>
            <p><strong>Positioning:</strong> how a brand positions itself compared to its rivals. Is it of better quality? Same quality but less expensive? Is it environmentally responsible? And so on. As the choice strongly depends on the current sector of activity in which the project is established, the relation to market strategy is pretty obvious.</p>
            <p>However, here, I imply a notion of the market which is far beyond the classical customer-seller financial transaction. We are talking of the market of trust. To put it concretely, the acceptance of a famous artist to collaborate with your brand happens in this market. For example, <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/rebuild-the-world/celebrate-black-creators" target="blank">the recent promotion of Ekow Nimako by Lego.<a></p>
            <p><strong>Tone:</strong> a commonly shared element through all communications. It corresponds to the attitude with which you are expressing your project. It can be funny, serious, mathematical, sensual, and so on. It helps to personify your brand and make it attractive and playful. The tone is the field in which you can play once the codes of your communication are set.</p>
            <p>For example, if you are launching a luxury watch brand like <a href="https://www.hublot.com" target="blank">Hublot</a>, you will have to fit with the codes of luxury and, more specifically, luxury watchmaking. This means high-quality communication support, pictures, a well-designed website, and so forth. Beyond this, Hublot decided to endorse a modern and dynamic tone. Their products are always presented with high-quality motion designs with groovy music. They also do partnerships with celebrities who are not expected as muses for luxury watchmaking but who fit Hublot's brand and dynamic tone consistently: Usain Bolt, Nicky Jam, and many others.</p>
            <p><strong>Packaging:</strong> in the end, branding and marketing merge into packaging because it is the support of the sale transaction as well as the last support of communication to reach a customer directly. It is the last resort of decision before a person buys a product and also the support she will have the longest time under the eyes. Obviously, the use of packaging is relative to the product. A chocolate bar and a car are not packaged the same way because it does not answer the same issues. It is more likely that the car will not have physical packaging as the sale is mainly followed by a dedicated seller who acts themselves as packaging.</p>
            <h3>Branding or marketing, which is the most important?</h3>
            <p>As you understood, there is no need for such a distinction. Both are paths that help us grow a project. They often go together and can be easily confused. The way they relate to each other depends on the organization. If you are confusing the growth of sales and the growth of a project, here is a good reminder: marketing's goal is to increase sales, and branding's goal is to increase value.</p>

        <h2>2. Branding, a whole new world</h2>
        <img class="line_subtitle" src="images/line.png" alt="line" width=700>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
            <h3>How is it possible that human beings are able to send stuff into space?</h3>
            <p>Well, some of us will say it's the mystery of life and, in a way, there's a part of it. But let's not be completely satisfied with that answer. The primary observation is that individuals can work together towards the same goal. As we said above, it happens thanks to a vision shared through a story. This is precisely where the process of branding occurs. <strong>The brand is a material substantiation of an ideal. Through its growth, it enhances its own power of conviction. The simple presence of a symbol tells us that a world we could create already exists.</strong></p>
            <h3>Brand strategy is about anticipating the best opportunities.</h3>
            <p>Brand strategy is a strategy among several. There are many different strategies possible depending on the type of brand. The diversity of brand strategy could be spread along an axis.</p> 
            <p>In one direction, materialistic values are attached to fill the strictly essential needs. The value of a good is attached to its value of use. TKnowing that needs are limited by definition, the available place to build an imaginary world in this direction is also limited. Still, this is where innovation is the most important. It is where imagination is balanced with the reality of the matter.</p>
            <p>In the other direction, we reach the fantasm of a world shaped entirely by our power of creativity. The most iconic representative of this vision is the luxury market. It is a world where symbols are of the strongest significance. Of course, what some may consider "superficial" plays an important role in the organization.</p>
            <p>Cultural celebrations such as weddings require costly clothes that are often worn once in order to signify the extraordinary of the situation. You could do the same dressed in a T-shirt. But we both know that most people will not hang on to this strict necessity and will be more likely to buy a dress or a tuxedo. Because signification is not virtual but creates the reality we live in. And this significance can tremendously increase the value of your product or service.</p>
            <h3>Brand strategy is to become part of reality through rituals of everyday life.</h3>
            <p>A wedding is just an example among other numerous ritualistic events. Shortly, rituals. But not rituals in the sense of shamanic rituals, no. We call it a ritual in the sense that it refers to the pre-establish nature of the interaction. As the sociologist Erving Goffman says, it is a social performance on which everybody agrees on its significance. The word "ritual" connotes the invocation of a heavy background that is synthesized in a symbolic gesture, just like what is observed in tribal rituals. A wedding is a spectacular ritual but there are much smaller ones. For example, the handshake is a ritual. It supports an accurate meaning and contributes to building the history we live in.</p>
            <p>These rituals are the concrete manifestations of the story we tell ourselves and branding is about focusing on these rituals in order to invite our brand to participate in this database of rituals that creates our reality. A good example of this process is the Kärcher brand which has almost become a generic brand. A brand becomes generic when its use has been made so common that everyone uses the brand to refer to the core concept itself.</p>
            <p>In France, we use "Scotch" and "Frigo" to designate tape and refrigerators. In actuality, Kärcher is now at the summit of what a brand can expect to be. At the same time, Kärcher is a brand, and the word refers to any kind of high-pressure water washing machine. The brand strategy's return on investment is that brand awareness almost raises itself now that Kärcher has been institutionalized as a commonly used concept and is officially part of the language. The brand must now keep its distinctive property so that it doesn't become a word used by anyone, especially its rivals. This is the golden age of a brand. It refers to every similar product on the market and is the only one profiting from this reputation, a situation leading to a semantic monopoly.</p>

            <h3>Brand strategy is a powerful plan for the growth of a commercial project.</h3>
            <p>Its objective is to increase the intrinsic value of a project by increasing the confidence of people in the field in which it operates. There is much to say about brand strategy, and everything can not stand in this article. The objective was to dress a silhouette of what brand strategy looks like and I hope you can better understand the process. This article will be improved in the future. I have drawn here the fundamental basis of how the concept of branding can be included in a strategy to help a project grow.</p>
            <p>Many other concepts are used by branding professionals, including the fundamental enunciation, semiology of colors, Kapferer's prism, and so on. To deepen your knowledge on this subject, I invite you to read the books <em>Analyzing Communication, the first and second tomes</em> by Andrea Semprini, which inspire you to appropriate the thinking process of a communication specialist. I also recommend the indescribable <em>Mythologies</em> from Roland Barthes, a building stone to seize imagination within contemporary societies.</p>
            <p>I hope this lecture enriched you. Please, send me a direct message if you have any comments or suggestions on how to improve this article. The comment section is not included yet so feel free to use the contact form to directly address me.</p>
